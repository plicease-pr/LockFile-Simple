SYNOPSIS

	use LockFile::Simple qw(lock unlock);

	lock('file') || die "Can't lock file\n";
	open(FILE, '>>file') || die "Can't append to file: $!\n";
	....
	close FILE;
	unlock('file');

DESCRIPTION

The LockFile::Simple extension provides simple file locking, of
the advisory kind, i.e. it requires cooperation between applications
wishing to lock the same files.

It is meant to be used in quick-and-dirty scripts or more elaborated
programs that want a simple locking scheme, yet with a reasonable
level of configuration.

This code comes from the mailagent-3.0 package and retains most
of its configuration abilities.

I do not intend to leave this simple scheme as-is forever. The code is
designed to be extended to offer other locking schemes, such as
MTA locking--usually a combination of this simple scheme and flock().

Despite being flagged as simple and not bullet proof all over the
place, locking is good enough for simple applications wishing to
protect against concurrent actions.

There is an embeded POD manual page in Simple.pm.
